Unreleased
==========

Added
-----
* Added experimental feature to mark dynamic pads as quasi_static. If this flag
  is set on a pad_instance, the config file parser will verify that there is
  exactly one and only one port connected to this pad_instance and will
  automatically set the default_port value to it.

v0.3.6 - 2022-12-14
===================

Changed
-------
* Prepare Metadata for Pypi release


v0.3.5 - 2022-12-14
===================

Added
-----
* Support for FuseSoC. Padrick now generated core files and can be invoked
  natively as a FuseSoC Generator.

v0.3.4 - 2022-12-06
===================

Added
-----
* User attributes now support nested dictionaries i.e. besides a string, boolean
  or an integer the value of an attribute can be another dictionary.
* The ``default_port`` field of pad_instances now support dictionaries of pad_name
  to port mappings. See the correspondingly updated ``default_port`` section in
  the docs.

Changed
-------
* User Attributes of ports, port_groups and pad_instances are now
  expanded as well when instantiated multiple times. The same mini
  expression languages applies.
* Improved manifest version warning messages
* Bumped manifest version to 3.

Fixed
-----


v0.3.3 - 2022-12-05
===================

Added
-----
* Added support for modular config file using pyyaml !include directives.

Changed
-------

Fixed
-----


v0.3.2 - 2022-10-21
===================

Added
-----
Added support for templated ``default_port`` in vectorized pad instances (pads with ``multiple`` > 1).

Changed
-------
Removed now obsolete hint about ``default_port`` with vectorized pad instances compatibility.


v0.3.1 - 2022-10-19
===================

Added
-----

Changed
-------

Fixed
-----
* Regression in driver template rendering that caused an error during the register file generation.


v0.3.0 - 2022-10-18
===================

Added
-----
* Added read-only IP info register with version id and pad count values to RTL template

Changed
-------
* Allow padframe generation without any muxed pads

Fixed
-----
* Fix address width bug in address demux rules when generating padframes with power's of two number of registers

v0.2.0 - 2022-25-04
===================

Added
-----
* Added support for multiple multiplex groups per pad/port. Each
  pad/port/port_group can now be member of severa mux_groups. This causes the
  union of all specified groups to be muxable to the pad,port or port_group in
  question.
* Add support for multi-ports. Ports now accept the new optional `multiple` key
  that allows to specify several port with similar structure without copy-paste-hell
* Add support for templated names, description and mux_groups to
  multi-pads/multi-ports using the '{i}' token. This feature simplifies the
  definition of GPIO ports. Check the example config file for an example on how
  to use the feature.
* Add version flag to CLI to print version information
* Add validation of manifest version. The CLI now prints out an error message if
  the manifest version is not supported anymore with a help message which
  version of Padrick supports the out-dated manifest version.
* Add mini expression language for template tokens.
* Render assignment macros in systemverilog package to simplify hierarchical assignements of port groups.
* Add optional format code feature to index templates.
* RTL generate command now supports supplying file headers to insert into the auto-generated files
* Auto-generate SystemVerilog header files with struct assignment macros
* Added optional key `default_port` to pad_instances of the form
  "<port_group_name>.<port_name>". This allows to specify a port that should be
  connected to the pad by default after reset. An error is raised if the
  specified default_port is not actually connectable to the pad (not in the same
  mux group).
* Added new CLI commands to customize internal Mako templates.
* Add optional user_attr key to padframe specification format. This allows users
  to tag pads, ports etc. with additional metadata and potentially use it within
  the custom templates.
* Add 'generate constraints' command to auto-generate SDC constraints for set_case_analysis of pad_mux config registers.
* Add new CLI generate command to render custom templates to support completely customized output formats
* Add more documentation on usage and structure of generated padrick output

Changed
-------
* Manifest version was increased to 2.
* Renamed `mux_group` key to `mux_groups` which now accepts a list of string instead of a single string.
* Updated  sample config files to be compatible with new manifest format.
* Switched to reg_interface version 3.1 and updated internal reggen version.
* Config file types of various fields to support expression language (makes fields like `default_static_value` incompatible with YAML integers)

Fixed
-----
* Fixed bug in toplevel padfram struct generation

0.1.0 - 2021-03-30
==================
Very first *alpha* release of Padrick with support for RTL Generation and Driver Generation.
